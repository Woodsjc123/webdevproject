C20357166 Web Dev Project - Restaurant App - Sushijet


Run npm i in root folder, server folder and client folder

To run the project, cd into the parent directory, and run 'npm run both'.
This will concurrently run the client (UI) on port 3000 and the server (API) on port 3001.
From there the browser should open the app.
The client uses a proxy to forward API requests to port 3001.
